    Lines 1 to 4 contain the tile pattern for the
    initial state and lines 6 to 9 contain the tile pattern for the goal state.

    Line 5 is a blank line.  n and m are integers that range from 0 to 15. Integer 0 represents a blank position and integers 1  to 15 represent tile numbers.

    Your program will produce an output text file that
    contains 14 lines  as shown in Figure 2 below.

    Lines 1 to 4 and lines 6 to 9 contain the tile patterns for the initial  and goal states as given in the input file. Lines 5 and 10 are blank lines.

    Line 11 is the depth level  d of the shallowest goal node as found by your search algorithm (assume the root node is at level  0.)

    Line 12 is the total number of nodes N generated in your tree (including the root node.)

     Line  13 contains the solution that you have found.
